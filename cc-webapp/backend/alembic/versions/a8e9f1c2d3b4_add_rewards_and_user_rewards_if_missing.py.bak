"""
Renamed to .bak to avoid Alembic parsing.
Original filename: a8e9f1c2d3b4_add_rewards_and_user_rewards_if_missing.py
Reason: File had no revision metadata and caused Alembic to fail resolving revision id at boot.

Project rule: Alembic must maintain a single head; invalid placeholder scripts must not be parsed.
Future: If needed, implement a proper revision with revision/down_revision against current head and idempotent ops.
